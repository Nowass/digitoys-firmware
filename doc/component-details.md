# 📦 Components Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the core software components. Each section links to a dedicated file with class diagrams, public API descriptions, and usage examples.

## 🎛️ Control Task

The heart of the DigiToys firmware, implementing the main control logic that orchestrates:

- LiDAR-based obstacle detection with dynamic thresholds
- RC input processing and vehicle state management  
- Safety-critical speed control with multiple intervention levels
- System state management and telemetry integration

👉 [See full Control Task API and architecture details](./control-task.md)

## 🟢 LiDAR Driver

The LiDAR driver handles:

- UART-based communication with the LiDAR device
- Frame parsing (angle, distance, confidence)
- Proximity filtering
- LiDAR motor control

👉 [See full LiDAR API and class details](./lidar-driver.md)

## 🟡 ADAS PWM Driver

This module manages PWM input/output channels for:

- Capturing throttle/steering signals (via RMT)
- Replaying or overriding PWM output (via LEDC)
- Supporting ADAS-controlled overrides like braking

👉 [See full ADAS PWM API and class details](./adas-pwm-driver.md)

## 🔵 Monitor

Responsible for:

- Collecting FreeRTOS statistics (heap, CPU, tasks)
- Converting system metrics into dashboard-friendly JSON

👉 [See full Monitor API and class details](./monitor.md)

## 🟢 BMI270 Driver

An accelerometer driver built around the Bosch BMI270 sensor. It exposes the
`IAccelSensor` interface and uses an I2C helper for bus access. The driver can be
polled via `dataReady()` or extended to trigger a GPIO interrupt for minimal CPU
usage.

## 🔁 Runtime Integration

All components are orchestrated by `ControlTask` from `main.cpp`, which:

- Implements the main control loop running at 50ms intervals (20Hz)
- Reads LiDAR data for obstacle detection and distance measurement
- Processes RC input signals to determine vehicle state and driver intent
- Applies sophisticated safety algorithms with speed-dependent thresholds
- Triggers PWM overrides for emergency braking and speed control
- Reports comprehensive system stats to the web dashboard
- Manages state transitions and provides diagnostic logging

The system uses a multi-task FreeRTOS architecture with priority-based scheduling to ensure real-time performance for safety-critical operations.
